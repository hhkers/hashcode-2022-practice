## Problem
You can find the problem statements [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/round/00000000008f5ca9/00000000008f6f33).

## Solution

The codes for the solution are in [Solve.ipynb](notebook/Solve.ipynb) and [src.cpp](src.cpp).

The solution follows these steps:

1. Processing ([Solve.ipynb](notebook/Solve.ipynb))

   1. Count ```likes```, ```dislikes``` and calculate ```like - dislike``` for each ingredient.
   
   2. Include the ingredients greater than ```0``` in 1.
   
2. Optimisation ([src.cpp](src.cpp))

   1. Random swap for 30 min


## Results
| File  | Score |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A - An example | 2 |
| B - Basic  | 5 |
| C - Coarse  | 5 |
| D - Difficult | 1,804 |
| E - Elaborate | 1,872 |
| **Total** | **3,688** |


With more optimisation, D and E might be improved.
